            You waited too long, you have innumerous pending tasks, your inbox is full, everything is late, you’re overwhelmed and not quite sure how things got this far. Perhaps it was the late-night Netflix binge or the nap to make up for the lack of sleep, but you’ve managed to put off all of your responsibilities until the last minute. Congratulations! You have successfully procrastinated. <br>
            This struggle often ends in an unshakable sense of guilt, for which the go-to solution is “chilling”. This coping mechanism is often miscatogorized as plain old laziness. <br>
            Procrastinators put off work for a variety of reasons. Some do it for the challenge, some do it out of fear of being judged while others claim they work best under pressure. After all, as a great person once said in an Instagram post, “Wait till the last minute to do your work, because then it only takes you a minute to do it”. <br>
            This may seem like a millenial concept, when in fact it has been around for generations. The great Leonardo da Vinci, was a little bit of a day-dreamer at the time. While his contributions to the fields of engineering, architecture, biology, botany, anatomy, math, and physics are invaluable, he never finished a project on time! <br>

          What made CS (specifically CS 1.6) so good was the fluidity of movement, the satisfaction of clutch situations, the economy system and the precise gunplay provided by the GoldSrc engine. And what eventually paved its way for becoming an eSport, was the fact that it had a skill ceiling so high, that only a handful of human beings could hit it. The mechanical skill it required in terms of aim, mouse control, muscle memory and so on, instantly attracted numerous players to give it a shot. <br>
          But the problem with CS 1.6 quickly became obvious. It was TOO good. So good that every attempt Valve made to iterate on it, was met with controversies. Its Xbox version failed miserably, making it clear that CS in consoles was just not meant to be. In 2004, its first sequel was released, CS : Source, quickly facing criticism because of the reduced skill ceiling, which was part of the brilliance of CS 1.6. This caused a division in the fanbase between Source apologists and professional players who still preferred 1.6. It was around this time that CS eSports began declining, with the MOBA genre taking over the arena with titles like Dota and League of Legends. <br>
          Valve had enough, and in 2012, released the latest iteration of the series and its most popular one, Counter Strike : Global Offensive (CSGO), aiding in the end of the civil crisis in the fanbase. Although it had improved graphics and new game modes, the game was met with heavy criticism because of the buggy mechanics, the instability of its new Source engine, and gameplay that made CS players step out of their comfort zones. However, with regular updates, launch of streaming services like Twitch and Ustream, the game eventually surpassed 1.6 in popularity. Professional players dedicated themselves once again to the game. The introduction of community maps which allowed fans to make their own maps, and skins to customize guns, only helped to make it more attractive to casual players as well. <br>

          The Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader who travels the world and promotes peace was quite the procrastinator while in school. “Only in the face of a difficult challenge or an urgent deadline would I study and work without laziness”, he recalled. However, having learned the lesson, he now advocates against procrastinating. <br>
          While putting off doing your homework or reading a book may turn out to be inconsequential, it may have a humongous impact in the real world. Getting out of your comfort zone is indeed a hard task but is also extremely rewarding. <br>
          Although the problem has been identified, there is no sure shot solution to overcome it yet, but there are a few things one can do to get rid of the habit. When working on crucial projects, <br>

          <p>  
            Have a personal vision: Creating a personal vision is an essential tool that not only helps you in understanding your skills and priorities, but it also helps you focus your effort on the right activities so that you don’t continually switch between tasks. <br>
            Create a To-Do Today List: A long list of tasks can frustrate us so much that we tend to give up on them completely. Maintaining a to-do today list can help you get the most important and urgent tasks done everyday with ease. <br>
            Cheers! If you reached this paragraph, this means you have successfully won the battle against procrastination! <br>
